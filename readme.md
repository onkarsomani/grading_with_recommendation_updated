# Grade Calculation System

## Overview
The Grade Calculation System is a JavaScript-based application that calculates student grades based on their marks and provides recommendations for improving their performance. It utilizes a scoring model that considers various thresholds and calculates both absolute and percentage-based grades.

## Features
- **Dynamic Grade Calculation**: Automatically calculates grades based on the total marks and predefined rules.
- **Recommendations**: Provides recommendations for students to achieve their desired grades.
- **Performance Tracking**: Tracks students' performance and allows for detailed analysis of their scores.
- **Flexible Input Handling**: Accepts marks as an array and calculates the grades accordingly.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML (for future UI enhancements)
- CSS (for future UI enhancements)

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grade-calculation-system.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd grade-calculation-system
   ```
3. **Open in a Code Editor**: Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.

## Usage
To use the grade calculation functionality, you need to call the `calculateGrades` function, passing an array of marks and the total course marks as parameters. 

### Example
```javascript
let marksArray = [85, 90, 75, 88, 92];
let courseTotal = 100;
let grades = calculateGrades(marksArray, courseTotal);
console.log(grades);
```

### Functions Overview
- `calculateGrades(marksArray, courseTotalInput)`: Takes an array of marks and the total marks for the course, calculates grades, and returns an array of calculated grades.
- `best(input)`: Determines the best scoring combination based on given criteria.
- `considerable(temp, starttar, endtar, cuts, n)`: Evaluates possible scoring combinations to meet specified target averages.
- `f(st, end, rem, temp, vv)`: Recursive function to generate possible score combinations.

## Code Structure
- `calculateGrades.js`: Contains the main functions for grade calculation.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file (if you choose to create a front-end interface).
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling (optional).
